# Recording Handbook

## Environment

- Find a quiet space, close the door, do your best to minimize interruptions
    - Prefer a room without lots of echo or outside noise.
    - Keep two closed doors between you & those pesky cats/dogs if possible. My cats really like to paw at doors when they're closed, I bet your pets do too. :)
    - Find a squeak-less chair
- Remove things you'll fidget with that could make noise
    - Find a stuffed animal or something soft to fidget with instead ðŸ™‚
- Grab a whiteboard/notepad for taking notes if you'd like -- taking notes on a keyboard adds a lot of noise.

## Equipment

- Local audio output through **enclosed** headphones or earbuds. I have a set of semi-open headphones and I can't use them for recording, because my recording track picks up what the other person is saying. We should avoid this if possible.
- Local audio input through a wired or internal microphone
    - Wired/hardware mics sound better than wireless/bluetooth mics! The sound gets really compressed over bluetooth due to limited bandwidth. We can filter out background noise picked up by your built-in mic, but we can't fill in audio compressed out by bluetooth.
    - If you have a fancy mic, great! If you don't, don't sweat it -- even the built-in mic likely sounds good enough. 

## Before Recording

- When logged into Zencastr for the recording, make sure the health checks pass
    - It will give you a message explicitly telling you that your health checks pass or fail
    - Make sure zencastr's input/output settings are correct for your recording setup. It might have selected a different mic or headset than your system settings. There's a settings gear in the top right of the UI to confirm.
    - Make sure you see squigglies (waveforms) when you talk.
- Turn off notifications
- We'll do a quick check to make sure your mic level is at an appropriate level for the recording

## While Recording

- Avoid touching the mic/bumping the desk/making noises *while you're speaking*
    - Don't worry about this stuff while you're not speaking because we can just mute it!
    - But if it overlaps your speaking, it's hard to edit it out.

## After Recording

- Stay logged into Zencastr long enough that it uploads your recorded track. This should take less than a minute, and I'll make sure it happens before I let you go :)
