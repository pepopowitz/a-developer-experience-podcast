# How Devs Work

A podcast showcasing the variety of skills, tools, and strategies developers use to get things done.

## What?

- A curated season of episodes around a specific topic related to how developers work
- Topic for this season: The systems we use to manage our time & work
- Somewhere between 6 and 12 episodes
- Between 15-30 minutes per episode
- Each episode will be focused on a subtopic, with stories/details from multiple guests

## Why?

- I'm fascinated by how people work. I'm always interested in finding ways to improve my personal workflow, tooling, and skills.
- I want a project for the upcoming winter.
- I'm looking to build my skills and resume for the field of developer relations.
- I want to experiment with a more curated/edited podcast format. I'm interested in taking editing time to craft a story instead of replaying interviews start to finish.
- I think most podcasts are too long, and lack cohesive stories across episodes

## How?

- Initial discovery (September) - survey to interested guests about what they can tell me about their personal workflow & systems
- Identify sequence of episodes based on survey results (October)
- Record interviews (October - November)
- Edit episodes (December - March)
- Release episodes (January - March)
