In this premiere episode of a developer experience podcast, I talk with Maggie Fernandes, a software developer and significant contributor to the Milwaukee development community. Among other things, we discuss the tension between handwritten and digital notes, days that feel good versus days that feel bad, and the stress of mental list keeping. I admire Maggie on many levels, and I think you're going to love this episode. 

So why don't you go ahead and take a little bit of time to tell me about yourself?

Maggie Fernandes  
Sure. My name is Maggie Fernandes. I am a software engineer here in Milwaukee, a career transitioner. So I've only been in the field for about a little bit over six years now. I work for a company called MacGregor partners. We work on supply chain software. And I'm also pretty involved in the community. I run Milwaukee's JavaScript group, MilwaukeeJS, as well as a nonprofit organization called We Pivot in which we work to create spaces for marginalized communities in tech.

Steven Hicks  
And I think I met you through the community at a meetup of some sort. And then we also organized a conference together for a couple years, I think, right? 

Maggie Fernandes  
Yes. 

Steven Hicks  
Awesome. Can you go ahead and tell me a little bit about the systems that you use to get things done right now? What works for you? And what does it look like?

Maggie Fernandes  
Sure. So I don't have a perfect system. But I guess this is what we're talking about, right? It's kind of a mash up of things. So right now, the one key digital tool that I really love is Evernote. So that's been working pretty consistently for me. And then I'm also a big journaler. That's a word. So I do have a journal, I actually use what's called a Passion Planner, which is kind of a mix between a journal and a planner. Reason being because I...based on some of my community activities, I meet with people in person a lot. So you don't have that opportunity of like, let me pop open my laptop or you know, take notes on my phone. So having like something to just jot down notes works really well. But Evernote for me is great, because then you have that archive searchable history. So it's a little bit easier. So definitely for all my work, like development work stuff, I lean hard on Evernote. But now that I'm doing a lot more project based stuff, I've added yet another tool, which is Asana, that I'm starting to love, because it really it connects a little bit better to different things. So it's a little bit easier to use. So Asana, I think might be my go to tool for 2022. That remains to be seen. But yeah, my two key ones right now are definitely my Passion Planner, and Evernote and then kind of transitioning slowly into Asana.

Steven Hicks  
Cool. I like that you are giving it basically a year to show whether it's worthy or not. Can you...So how do you kind of...is there any disconnect between what you're writing in paper, and then what you're putting into these digital tools? Do things get dropped, lost along the way? Or how do you deal with that? How do you account for that?

Maggie Fernandes  
So yeah, so that's what I try. And again, this is where the system becomes imperfect. Because whenever...being remote actually now has been helpful because I do a lot more meetings via zoom. So then I'm taking notes and into directly into Evernote as those meetings are happening, which is great. And, and I can you know if there's a checklist and I know I'll highlight things, and I'll make a you know, leave something as a checkbox. So I know to come back and do it. When I do it in the written form, then it's a little bit harder because I have to allow for time afterwards to go back and kind of update systems and add into an actual to do list or calendar or something. So all of that is added work. And so the ultimate goal is to have a system that eliminates that kind of like follow up to the system that requires you to come back and like edit things and do things. So that's where things will fall through the cracks. Sometimes I will write a note in here, and then as I'm flipping through, like two days later, I'm like, Oh, wow, I totally forgot I wrote that down. And I needed to update that or do that. So...

Steven Hicks  
Do you have any sort of like cadence that you go back and review your paper notes just in case you lost stuff? 

Maggie Fernandes  
Yeah, so I am kind of like I am also a big writing utensil kind of person, by that I love pens. I love highlighters. I'm big into like Japanese pens and stuff. So that helps a little bit because everything is color coded. So I do color code things and I do check things off. So visually, it's easy to see if I've missed something. So I'll do like, what I try to do is every morning allow for time first thing in the morning to kind of prep for the day by reviewing the previous day and kind of following things through to the next day as what needs to be added to the checklist. What needs to be...if I need to put something into digital form or calendar something or send off an email, then I do that. But if anything throws that off, then that's when it becomes a problem.

Steven Hicks  
How often does that get thrown off, do you think?

Maggie Fernandes  
At least once a week, right? There's like, you know, that morning that you barely have time to have a cup of coffee, nevermind allow yourself planning time first thing in the morning.

Steven Hicks  
Yeah. And then you're just sucked into everything right away.

Maggie Fernandes  
Oh, yeah. Then you're playing catch up all day.

Steven Hicks  
Yeah, I'm definitely familiar with that experience. Do you take any time at the end of the day to do any kind of review or recap of how things went?

Maggie Fernandes  
Yes. And that's like, the days that psychologically I feel so amazing. At the end of the day, you feel so accomplished, and you're like, I've been productive. And I can, even if I'm carrying things over to the next day, I feel like there's been closure to the day. And so that is the goal, at the end of the day to always kind of go back and check things off and push, you know, try and push things through. So in the morning, I have already a good start off place. However, there are days again, which happens at least a couple of times a week, where at the end of the day, I'm so burnt out that the last thing I want to do is then add on time for that kind of thing. So yeah, so it sometimes it doesn't happen. It's never a perfect process. But ideally, that's the thing, at the end of the day, I feel so proud of myself, when I'm like I've done all this but or even if I didn't do this, I have a log of it. And I keep it going because I am involved in so many different things. You know, so it's almost a focus mechanism, being able to pull it out of your brain and put it down on something, whether it is writing it down in my planner or putting it in Evernote. Because then it's accounted for. And you don't have those moments that like you have that interruption and thought because you're in the middle of doing something else. And you're like, Oh, I forgot to do this, or oh, I need to write a note about this. So I try to eliminate as much of that as possible, always kind of constantly having things listed and checked off. Even if it doesn't get done as long as it's part of a list, then I feel better about it. It's probably just a mental thing. But it works for me.

Steven Hicks  
No, I think it definitely works for me too. I think that that's a definitely a good thing to eliminate any of that list keeping that you're doing in your head and turn it into...let your brain focus on other things, like the individual thing that you're trying to do, instead of trying to manage where all of the things are. That's great. So you talked about how if you have the start of the day, and you have the end of the day, and you get time in both of those to just do some planning or review of what you did that those are the psychologically good days. Are there any other things that make you feel throughout this process, like I did a great job, anything that affects you emotionally in a positive way when it happens?

Maggie Fernandes  
Yeah, I love when like there's...the Passion Planner is perfect, because it's actually broken down into personal work and like Game Changer goals. So then there's allowed time for everything versus like, it's all work, or it's also...because again, I try to do so many different things. It's great to be able to section it off. But then I also love when there's time to give myself feedback, which may sound a little odd. But if there's something that I, I can take a little note that says, you know, remember next time do this, or it was great that I approached it this way. So it's kind of then goes beyond just like I check something off my list. But then I also allow time for a learning moment, a growth moment, that also makes me feel psychologically really great and positive about the day. So I always look forward to that.

Steven Hicks  
Yeah, I'm picturing you just like with a wall of post-its. Like things that went well. Like you're doing a retro for yourself. 

How about the opposite? What are the things that make you feel bad about how it's going, or make you feel down, when things don't happen as part of your system, or when things do happen to your system?

Maggie Fernandes  
That's when I'll look at my planner and instead of all the neatly checkboxes and everything is filled out it's all on the other page, just a blank page and there's like the notes that are going vertical, you know, at an angle and it's all everything's meshed together and that...it's just because I feel like it's a visible representation of what's going on in my brain and so frightens me a little bit because it's like I'm all over the place. And so I'm always like, Did I miss something? What did I miss? Then it's like you're always waiting for that shoe to drop because you're like something must have been missed this day. So those are the days that aren't exactly the best. Because it's like I feel like I did nothing, it's just blank pages and just randomness all over. So yeah.

Steven Hicks  
So are there ways that you know have to come back from that? How do you get yourself back into a state of feeling good?

Maggie Fernandes  
Oh, then it's really like then I force myself to allow that planning time. And one of the great things about this physical planner, it has a mood thing so it has little happy faces and sad faces and so you can circle which mood you're in. So then for the next day, I circle a happy face right away because I'm like, we're choosing our mood for today. And we're kind of like, we're gonna go ahead and set up the day as best as we can. Because if you continue in that, it's a domino effect, right. And if you allow that to happen, then every day is going to follow the same cadence. So if today was crazy, and you don't stop to  fix it and address it for tomorrow, then tomorrow is going to follow the same thing, and it's going to be crazy. So when that happens, I know my day is only going to be as great as I plan it to be. Because there's always days that you have zero control, it'll, you know, be out of your control, and it'll go crazy. But if you can have those moments that you can plan for it, or you force yourself to plan for it. Because I think sometimes too, it's all a mental thing that like, if I don't start working at eight o'clock, then I'm like, I need to be...15 minutes is going to be okay, if you take up fifteen minutes. Because we all know, the minute you turn on your laptop, it all goes. So before even turning it on, grab a cup of coffee, grab your planner, or whatever it is that your tool is and just focus on that. Keep all the other tabs closed, and just give yourself...whether it's like a time box 10 or 15 minutes to just get it all planned out. Your day always ends up being so much better when you do that and you allow for that time. So when things are starting to fall off the rails, that's what I do is I force myself to plan that planning time.

Steven Hicks  
That's awesome. Does it sometimes take you more than a day to realize that or are you pretty much at this point trained to recognize almost within a day that you've gone off the rails and you need to get back?

Maggie Fernandes  
Now I think... I think it was something that with working from home, because I didn't previously work from home, and with a pandemic, having to work from home and being like you are your office, and you are your team for the most part. Being in a good mental place, and that mental health is so much more important than it's ever been before. So I think now I'm pretty in tune with myself knowing that, okay, ...and beyond just kind of like even if my apartments a mess, I know that that's not a good thing, because that's going to spiral into every other part of my life. So just making sure when I see these things started to happen, stopping them as soon as I can and just kind of, okay, get everything in order, because you work better - because I'm definitely not the kind of person that works well in chaos. I definitely need an organized space and an organized list. And that's where I thrive and I feel my best. And that doesn't mean...other people do exceptionally well in the other way. And that's great. But it's good to just know yourself and know where you perform your best and create those spaces for yourself. So the older I get, the better I'm getting at that at understanding, this is what you need. You're not the fly by the seat of your pants kind of gal. And that's okay. Understanding that about myself. So yeah, to to answer your question. Absolutely. Now I can pretty quickly realize when things are starting to go off and force myself to kind of get back on track.

Steven Hicks  
That's cool. That's like a level of self awareness that is super impressive. Is there... throughout your life, was there ever a time where that wasn't the case? I phrase this question in the guide that I gave you is like, what are you running from? At some point, something in the past happened where you're like, oh, shit, I need to get my stuff together. Does that play into this at all? 

Maggie Fernandes  
It does. And I think it's it's mainly because I've learned, I grew up with like brothers who were always like, they have one passion, one focus. And I've never been that person. So a lot of times, I would kind of beat myself up a little bit about that. Because I would just be like, Why can't you just focus on this one thing? Why can't you just go deep on this one thing? And I could never get my brain to do that. Because I was always like, Oh, this was cool. I wish I want to learn about this or oh, let me try this. So now I think the older I've gotten, I take that as a strength but understanding as well that even though it's a strength, you still have to kind of learn how to curtail that, and how do you put that in order and make that work? Because otherwise you do end up like a goldfish and you're always constantly distracted and like here here here here. Like now it's a good thing. It's a great skill set to have lots of passions and be interested in a lot of things. But then how do you create a system for yourself so that you can manage it all and do it all to... It'll never be done to perfection. I've also allowed room for that to know that there's no such thing as perfection, but it needs to be manageable, and it needs to be you know, organized and all of that. So that's kind of what's guided me to this place of you have to have a system. You have to color code it all otherwise it ain't gonna work.

Steven Hicks  
Totally. What you were just talking about is actually really timely, I guess, because it's something that I've kind of been playing around with a little bit lately. I have this tendency to, like you said, be like a goldfish and just like, every three seconds just bounce from one thing to the next. And I've kind of been embracing it a little bit at home, in terms of chores or getting stuff done around the house or whatever. Where I'm like, you know, I know that it'd be really nice if I could focus on cleaning the bathroom right now, it would be great if I just stayed here, and I did that whole thing. But also, it's okay that I do this one thing in the bathroom, and then I walk into the kitchen, because I want something there. And I see something that needs to be done there. And I do it. And then I walk into the living room and see something that needs to be done there. And it's okay for me to just bounce around all these places, because I'm still being productive and doing all these little things. And I'm kind of at a point with it where I'm like, No, I don't actually don't think that that's a good way, I don't think that's a good way to embrace that part of my personality, because, man, it really just feels like I am pulled in a ton of different directions. So that's something that I've been thinking lately about trying to kind of curtail that behavior and fit and maybe go back to what I was trying to do before, which is trying to keep myself focused on one thing at a time.

Maggie Fernandes  
Yeah, it's a challenge, it is a challenge. But I think like, whatever gives you that mental sense of accomplishment, and I think that's where the checklists come in, right? And it's just like timeboxing things. And it's like, okay, if I get two done off of this list, and one done off of that list, it's a great day. Not thinking I have to get 100% off of each list done. Because then you set yourself - because there's also the opposite of that, too, of the list making. And I think we've all fallen into that, when we make those like super aggressive lists. And then at the end of the day, even though you've done a lot of things, you feel bad, because you didn't do all the things. Not stopping to realize that there was no possible way that you were ever going to be able to accomplish all the things. Allowing for the running list too I think is a good thing. So now it's like, there's pleasure. Because usually, it's like the checkbox, the check mark gives me pleasure. But there's also pleasure in doing just the sideline, which to me, is just like it's continued to the next day. That's okay.

Steven Hicks  
Right, it's not necessarily like you have control over it, but you've taken as much control over it as you can. And said, I acknowledged that this isn't getting done today. I am going to work on it more tomorrow. 

Maggie Fernandes  
Exactly. 

Steven Hicks  
And that's kind of a nice, a nice little, I guess, twist on what's going on. Give yourself the illusion of control, if nothing else.

Maggie Fernandes  
That's perfect. That's a perfect way to put it.

Steven Hicks  
Are you the kind of person who adds things after the fact just so they can check them off?

Maggie Fernandes  
I have done that. And I'm okay with that.

Steven Hicks  
There's no shame. No shame in it. For sure, cool. Okay, I'm gonna shift a little bit to maybe talk about opportunities for improvement, like, what are the things that you feel like you still need to figure out yet? And maybe what are some things that you've tried that didn't work that you want to try again? Or try in a different way?

Maggie Fernandes  
Yeah, so for me, things that I want to try is because a lot of the work that I do, especially outside of work work is pretty project based. And sometimes I tend to hone in on like what's right in front of me, and you need to be able to see the bigger picture. So which is why like, I'm excited with Asana, because it's a tool that doesn't just allow me to write down the tasks of the to do's that need to happen, within this week or within, you know, the next couple of days kind of thing. But it allows me to do a big picture scope of what needs to get done, and then chunk those out into smaller pieces. And even if I have to assign them to new team members, I can do that I can pull in documents and save, all of that. So that's why I'm excited for that, even though hopefully, it doesn't become a huge thing. And start to defeat the purpose of it all. But I want to be able to do that because sometimes too, it's kind of like Evernote is great because I keep notes of ongoing... I have all the history and it's a great way of doing the notebooks and the notes in each notebook. So it's very journal-y kind of, which is why it works really well with my brain. And then it keeps that whole sequence and, and so I love that part of it. But I think I need more of a project management kind of roadmap-y kind of tool to help with the other aspect of what I want to do because there's so many program development things that I would like to do or that I'm working on, that a tool like that works a little bit better for beyond managing just the day to day accomplishments.

Steven Hicks  
Are there any other difficulties with that shift, that shift of going from the more fine grained, individual level of control items that you can do versus this bigger picture project level as you described it? Where you're thinking more about strategy, and all those kinds of things. Any other things worth mentioning that make it difficult?

Maggie Fernandes  
I think for that, sometimes the maintainability of that, too can become difficult because I remember before I used to use...oh what was the tool? With the same kind of boards and stuff?

Steven Hicks  
Trello? 

Maggie Fernandes  
Trello! Yes, I was a big fan of trying to create as many boards as many things and sometimes, the more you can create you become your worst enemy, right? Because then you overthink things, and you add so many things to it. And if you're not on top of it, and maintaining and keeping it up to date constantly, then it becomes outdated so quickly that it's no longer useful. So that's why I stopped using Trello. Because it was like, okay, yeah, that didn't work out for me. But I'm hoping with Asana. (laughs) Exactly New Year, new me. Hoping that will work out a little bit better. But yeah, so I think that is definitely the danger of using a tool like that is if you're not maintaining it consistently, then it can get too big and too soon out of control. And then it's no longer useful.

Steven Hicks  
Yeah, you just can't even get your head into something that you haven't looked at for a while. You just throw it away and start over. 

Maggie Fernandes  
Yep. 

Steven Hicks  
I also used to be a Trello user, I also have a Trello account with like 40 different boards on it that I haven't looked at in a really, really long time. I don't know, sometimes it works for you. And then when it stops working for you, it just falls apart really, really quickly, which is I guess, kind of why I wanted to talk about all this stuff. I'm not feeling at this point like my system is falling apart. But it's also kind of nice to, at the very least have this meta conversation and get more aware of what's working for me and why it's working for me. 

So yeah, I guess maybe on that note, do you have any thoughts about that meta side of it? Why does this stuff work for you? And why doesn't it?

Maggie Fernandes  
I think for me some of the... especially the Passion Planner works for me, because of the fact I think it's very psychological. Even just like I said, even just getting it out of my brain and putting it down on paper is a sense of accomplishment. Even if I didn't check a single thing off the list, then I feel like I have more control over my life. Versus when different things that I've used, like, either the Trello, or I even used to have a post-it note thing of like a zillion and one post-it notes. And that just felt like everything was out of control. Even though it was a color coded out of control, it was out of control.

Steven Hicks  
It was still pieces of paper all fallen on the floor.

Maggie Fernandes  
Exactly. You're like oh, yeah, there was a post-it note there. Yeah, but this is just like having this little black book that closes up and has different colored tabs for the different months. And it's like, oh, that all feels so great to me. And the fact that even within the day, everything is broken up by, what is a work task? What is a community task? What is a personal task, all of that, feels like life is under control. You've got it all planned out. You haven't done anything, but you've got it all planned out.

Steven Hicks  
Right, you know exactly how your inaction is going to lead to your inevitable doom. 

Maggie Fernandes  
Absolutely. 

Steven Hicks  
I guess there's a lot to that, of just having that awareness and knowing, being able to maybe, like see how things are going before they happen? 

Maggie Fernandes  
Exactly. Definitely. 

Steven Hicks  
I mean, honestly, that is great. To have a day where you can start your day, and you can say ahead of time, I know that today is going to be a mess. And I know that I'm gonna basically have no time to do the things that I want to do. It makes it a lot easier to handle than if you were to start that day with "it's just another day." And then at the end of the day, you feel like crap, because you haven't done anything that you want it to do.

Maggie Fernandes  
Yeah. And sometimes what I'll do, and I've done this in the past is I'll start a day in which I will write down all these tasks. And to your point, I know that I'm only going to probably be able to do two. So before the day even starts, I will do that continuity, like check it off in the sense of like, it's gonna get done tomorrow. And even that makes me feel better, because it alleviates some of the pressure. Like, I've got 20 things I need to do, but I'm only going to do two, the rest is going to have to wait until tomorrow and that's okay. And so that's like, it's a plan to... putting it off, which is okay, it's still under control. So I feel better about myself. And that sometimes too is kind of, alleviating some of that pressure is a good thing.

Steven Hicks  
Yeah, yeah. Giving yourself the freedom to be imperfect. It's kind of nice. 

Maggie Fernandes  
Absolutely. 

Steven Hicks  
Cool. Last couple of questions that I have for you are do you have any examples or stories of times when this kind of system has really failed you or really helped you that come to mind?

Maggie Fernandes  
Yeah, I mean, definitely, when I first started my journaling, I've always wanted a notebook. And there were systems that I've created. Even as I look like to my side here, I have all these little mini journals that I used to use, because there was one time that I was like, I'll have a notebook for everything. And so now I just have a bunch of notebooks. When am I ever going to get a chance to go through and read through them. At the time, though, it felt like such a great system because everything was labeled, and it was like great, they're all black notebooks, which to me that simplicity of it all felt great. And I had a place to put a note depending on what project I was working on. So that felt great. But then at the end of the day, it was like, uh no, this is definitely not working. So it was this system that started off with great excitement and like, felt really positive about it. And then halfway through, I was like, Yeah, this isn't working. 

Steven Hicks  
It's kind of overwhelming. There's a lot of friction there to, basically, make a note, you have to figure out which book to put it in. And then you have to find it in a pile. That's fun.

Maggie Fernandes  
Yeah. But I think the other part too, is there's a struggle between being digital and that more physical note taking. Because sometimes I will take a note, and then I'll talk to one of my partners, and I'll be like, Oh, I should send you and then I'm like, Oh, I wrote that down. And it's not like I can copy, paste and send you so that too is kind of a constant. I've even went down that whole black hole of watching the YouTube notetakers, like they do the digital note taking on the iPads and all of that stuff. And I was like, maybe this is the next thing for me. That's a very expensive next thing, so let's hold off before we go down that path.

Steven Hicks  
Yeah, do some smaller experiments first. Do you think that there is a time where you won't be writing things down on paper? Do you think that that's always going to be part of it?

Maggie Fernandes  
I think that's always going to be part of it. Because ever since I was a little kid, I've always been a person that loves a great highlighter, loves a great pen, loves a beautiful notebook, loves a pencil case. So I think I would have a hard time letting go of that. I think it may be that maybe that transitions to more journals for my reading and in a different space in my life versus workspace. But I think I'll always be somebody that will have to write things down. And I think it's also how my brain in order to slow it down sometimes, the process of writing it down helps me comprehend it a little bit better. Which is kind of odd for somebody who's a developer to say, but that's just how my brain works.

Steven Hicks  
Yeah, no, I think that that's great. I feel like that's an experience I remember from college, especially was taking notes on paper was way better than anything else. That actually made things stick in my head. 

Maggie Fernandes  
Yeah, for sure. 

Steven Hicks  
Yeah. Cool. Are there any things that we haven't talked about in regards to this that you think we should talk about? 

Maggie Fernandes  
Um, no, I mean, I love this idea. Because even for me, this whole Passion Planner was actually something I hadn't heard of. And I have a group of female developers that like we are on Slack together. And we kind of share all kinds of things. And we have a journaling channel. And it was the beginning of last year, and everybody was like, What's everybody gonna do for this year, like journal and everybody kind of shared their systems. And that's how I learned about the Passion Planner, and I've loved it, and I've shared it with other people. So I think it's always great to kind of be open to improving your system and listening to what's out there, which is why I'm excited to hear more of these episodes, because I want to learn new things. And there might be a tool out there, that could be a great combination of everything that I'm doing that I'm not aware of. So yeah, but I think regardless of what your tool is, for me, what I found the most important thing that definitely is just helpful is it just make time for the planning. Regardless of how you're doing it, and what you're using. Just the making the time for it, I think is what really helps is just...instead of jumping into your day,  you have to give yourself that mental space to just read and plan for the day.

Steven Hicks  
Yeah, and we talked about how you make time at the beginning of the day, and at the end of the day, do you also make time at a I guess less frequent cadence to kind of review the system and look for opportunities to improve it, look for ways to make things more efficient or remove friction from anything?

Maggie Fernandes  
Not consistently. But one of the great things about the Passion Planner is that mid year it actually has an exercise for you to go through. Like how's the year going? What's been working, what hasn't been working? So that I've loved about it, that it actually puts that in there for me, so if I haven't made time once I'm flipping through it, I'm like, oh, it's that time of year. I should do this.

Steven Hicks  
Yeah, that's great. Yeah, that's that's something that...I don't know. For me I know that there's a threshold somewhere and I don't know what it is where I'm like, when I'm doing something, if it takes too much effort, or it takes too much time, or it doesn't give me enough satisfaction or whatever, I'm just like, Okay, I'm not going to do this, or I'm gonna keep doing this the bad way. And I know that I can keep doing it the bad way, and it'll be fine. It's just like a little extra. It's a few extra seconds or whatever. But I'm just very curious how people think about, like, where is that threshold where you sit down and you're like, Okay, I need to refactor this part of this system, because it's not working. Or just kick the can down the road. Do you have any thoughts about that?

Maggie Fernandes  
I mean, for me, when I get frustrated when it's adding to my workload is when then I'm like, Okay, this, I got to look at this or figure out a better way of doing this or find a new system. Part of I think why some of the things that I do work well is because I actually enjoy doing it. Every time I pull up an Evernote, there's this little part of me that gets excited about creating a new note. And it's odd, but that's just how I work.

Steven Hicks  
They have tuned that tool very, very well.

Maggie Fernandes  
Yes. And I'm like, I get excited about my new checklist. When I check it, it actually crosses it off too that's fantastic! All these little mental things that are like, that works for me. So there's excitement there. But whenever there's other things that I'm doing that are part of my system, that becomes like, oh, a chore, now I have to go and update this or..., then I'm like obviously this is not working. Or if it's the end of the week, and I'm like, Oh, I haven't touched this all week long and I really need to update it. That's when I start to think there's gotta be an easier way, there's gotta be a better way of doing this. So that's usually kind of my mental thing, because I'm definitely the kind of person that, as I think most of us are, will do the thing that we enjoy doing. And that's the stuff that we'll do more than most frequently and well. And so that's that's how I weigh it out and like, if I'm doing it all the time and really enjoying and looking forward to it, then that's working. If not then it's time to move on and get rid of it.

Steven Hicks  
That was everything that I wanted to talk about. there anything else you wanted to bring up?

No, thank you for this. This was fun.
