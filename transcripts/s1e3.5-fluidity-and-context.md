## In-betweener: Fluidity and context in our systems
### [Episode link]()

**Steven Hicks:** [00:00:00] Hey friends, it's me, Steve Hicks, with another in-betweener. This time about the fluidity of our systems and the importance of context. 

When I started this project of documenting people's productivity systems and the emotional impact that they have, I had it in my head that I was on a search for the perfect productivity system for me.

Like someday my search would be completed. I'd have this system that just always worked. Maybe not fully completed, but like 90% completed. Maybe there would be the occasional thing that fell through the cracks, but for the most part, my systems would trend towards fully solved as time went on. Something happened in the middle of this project that completely changed my mind.

I got a new job. And this changed some things that really disrupted my systems, especially my role and responsibilities and the environment around me. 

In regards to role and responsibilities, [00:01:00] I'm working significantly more independently than I was at my previous job. Previously, I was collaborating multiple times every day. While I was at Artsy, I wrote about how I saw myself as an individual contributor with a manager's schedule. Because I was so into the collaborative aspect, I selected myself into so many things. 

That meant I had a lot of small windows of time throughout the day, but very few large blocks to do deep focus. So I spent a lot of time and effort making those small blocks valuable. I started categorizing to-dos as shallow or deep.

During my many small blocks of time, I'd knock out some of that shallow work and I'd save the deep tasks for large blocks of time, which were much less frequent. And in fact, I usually had to schedule those ahead of time on my calendar so that they didn't get split up. Deep focus time was a scarcity. Shallow time was in abundance. When I entered a small block of time, I trained myself to do shallow work. And when I entered a large block of time, to do deep work.

Now that I'm at Camunda, I'm working more [00:02:00] independently and I now have the opposite problem. I have a ton of deep focus time every single day, and I have very few small blocks of time in between meetings or collaboration sessions, basically because I don't really have meetings or collaboration sessions.

It took me the last eight months to realize that my system of categorizing things as shallow and deep was no longer working because I so rarely have those small blocks of time for shallow work. All of my shallow work has been falling through the cracks. I'm still working on resolving this. I've started scheduling a half hour for shallow work every day. Some days that works and some it doesn't because I just jump into deep work right away. 

In regards to the environments around me changing, one example of that impacting my systems is in regards to planning my day. At Artsy, I planned my day on my own, updating and prioritizing my tasks in Todoist each morning.

Now at Camunda, everyone on my team starts their day by responding to a standup bot in Slack, which includes listing out our priorities for the day. Everyone's response is shared with the rest of the [00:03:00] team, so we can all see what we're up to. Initially, this resulted in an interesting conflict. I'd plan my day on my own in Todoist, then I'd plan it differently with the standup bot.

And then I'd typically follow Todoist as a guide for the day. It took me a couple months to notice that I was telling my team a completely different plan than what I was actually doing. 

At that point, I pretty much stopped planning Todoist in the morning and started relying on my standup response as a guide for the day. I still used Todoist, but mostly for one off things that came up throughout the day. This was actually pretty frustrating because I felt like I was losing track of things. I was never looking in the right place for them. 

More recently, I think I've settled into a happier place, planning my day with this standup bot than transferring the tasks to Todoist, and throughout the day looking only at Todoist as a guide. I like having one source of truth, even if it means a little extra work at the start of the day. 

This is all fine. Everyone's constantly working on their systems. I'm no different, but what [00:04:00] this experience has helped me become more aware of is that our systems are really just adaptations to our context.

There's no one system that will work for everyone. There's also no one system that will work universally for even one person. It's like the introvert, extrovert conversation. I'm neither universally. In some contexts, like meeting a bunch of new people I'm an introvert. In a similar but slightly different context, like hanging out with people I already know, I'm a strong extrovert. 

In the past, when part of my system would stop working for me, I would get frustrated and I would eventually blame myself for it no longer working. Maybe not initially, I know that not everything works for everyone, but my self-talk usually eventually turns to shaming and blaming myself.

Now, I guess I'm more conscious that when part of my system stops working, it's probably that the context -changed. That particular habit or practice, or that part of my system, was an adaptation to my context and it became unnecessary, or it was no longer sufficient for my new context. [00:05:00] 

The previous episode with Jon, we talked a lot about self-compassion and forgiveness. Spoiler alert about next week's episode with Christina Aldan, we're gonna talk more about self-compassion and forgiveness. And that's, I guess, what I want you to walk away from this in betweener with. When one part of your system stops working or when someone shares with you a practice that works really well for them, but you just can't get it to work, remember that it's probably far more about a difference in context than it is a reflection of any of your shortcomings.

And maybe that's obvious, and I'm the only one just figuring this stuff out. In that case, at least this is a nice reminder. 

All right, take care, friends, and thanks for listening.
