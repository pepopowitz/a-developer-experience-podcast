Steven Hicks: [00:00:00] Hello! My name is Steve, Steve Hicks. I read it as Steven. I speak it as Steve, and I'm very sorry for being difficult about that. I'm a software engineer, currently working as a developer experience engineer. And I think of developer experience as basically this. If you are a developer, I want you to have a nice time with the tools that you're using.

If there are massive hurdles between you and success, I wanna make those hurdles smaller or remove them entirely. If you get tiny paper cuts every day from your tools, I want to reduce the number of paper cuts. And so you're probably thinking that this show is about the field of developer experience.

It's a good guess. It says it in the name, A developer experience podcast. But the name of this show is kind of intentionally misleading. I get a lot of joy out of the ambiguity and fluidity of words, and this is one of those times. This show is less about the field of developer experience, or Dev Ex or DX, or whatever you wanna call it.

And it's more about the experience of being a developer. More generally about the [00:01:00] experience of being in the tech industry, and even more generally about the experience of being a person in the age of high technology. I fall back to developers because that's who I know, and that's mostly who I'll be talking to.

But to be honest, I think there's gonna be a lot of these experiences that we talk about that will be applicable to a lot more than just developers. Um, and some of my guests aren't gonna have anything to do with development. So yeah, it is probably a bad name and it is certainly a solid demonstration of my poor marketing skills, but I think it's gonna be really fun.

Season one of this show is a handful of conversations that I've recorded on the broad topic of productivity. I talk with my guests about a lot of different tools and practices, but we also talk a lot about the emotional side of being productive or unproductive, and that's gonna be a big focus for all seasons.

I really love talking about feelings in the context of our jobs. That's where the name of the show really comes from. The experience of being a developer is more than just writing code. [00:02:00] It's about working with other humans, navigating frustrations and trying to do all this while also being a human being who has emotional triggers and habits and loops that they fall into, and just feelings in general.

I'll be launching season one episodes every couple weeks. If you were playing along in the early formations of the show, you'll know that I'd intended to do far more cutting, editing, and reassembling of these episodes into cohesive stories. But as is pretty typical for me, I set the bar for myself a little too high. And since perfection is the enemy of good and for the sake of shipping something, you're gonna listen to these conversations mostly uncut.
