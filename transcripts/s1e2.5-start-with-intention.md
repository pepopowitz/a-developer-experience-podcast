# s1e2.5-start-with-intention

**Steven Hicks:** [00:00:00] Hey friends, this is Steve. I just wanted to drop in with a little mini episode this week. I am hoping to do more of this as the season goes on. I'm gonna call these little episodes in betweeners. Interviews are still gonna be released every other week, but when I have time and I have thoughts to share, I will ship one of these mini episodes.

This week I wanted to call out something that was discussed in both of the first two episodes -that's starting your day with intention. And honestly, this is something that came up in probably every conversation I recorded this season. Our best days start with intention. Maybe that's planning out Pomodoro's or it's reviewing yesterday's task list and seeing what gets carried over in the next episode. My friend Jon refers to something that he calls a start list that he runs.

Whatever shape this takes, starting your day with an activity that gives you visibility into what your day should look like and quite honestly, helps you establish control - that is something to aim for. [00:01:00] The days that every one of us struggles with are the days where you just get roped into something and you don't have time to plan.

You don't have time to think about what you should be doing for the day because you're too busy reacting and doing something else. Obviously those days can't be completely stopped. They're still going to happen. But I just wanted to make a note - and probably as much for me as it is for you, because I forget this all the time - but the quickest way to a bad day is to skip right past the beginning.

If you're listening to the show for ideas of how to improve your systems and you're not already starting your days by setting intention, I think that is the best advice I can give you. And if you're like me, And you know that you should be starting your day this way, but you don't always remember to do it... or let's be real, sometimes you consciously choose not to do it because you think it's just not that important.... consider this a nudge to try to stick to this practice more closely. 

I will be back next week with an interview with my friend Jon Allured. [00:02:00] He will be sharing a lot of good stuff about how he works very hard to appear like he's incredibly disciplined, because if he's not, he loses the battle.

All right. Thanks for hanging out.
