**Steven Hicks:** [00:00:00] In this episode of a Developer Experience podcast, I talk to my friend Eric Potter about his systems, and he goes deep on the Pomodoro technique. When we recorded this episode, Eric was a principal software architect. He's now the director of Technology Education at Sweetwater. Enjoy the show.

**Eric Potter:** My name's Eric Potter. I am a principal architect for Core BTS. I work out of our Fort Wayne office. 

**Steven Hicks:** Eric, can you tell me a little bit about what works for you in terms of getting your work done, managing tasks getting through the day to day stuff? 

**Eric Potter:** Yeah, and that's, that's such an interesting question and one of the things you have to remember about where I'm at, I'm almost 20 years. And so things that work for me now wouldn't have necessarily worked in the past. Right? 

**Steven Hicks:** Yeah, definitely. 

**Eric Potter:** So like me giving my past self advice, [00:01:00] my past self to be like, Ah, that doesn't fit what I'm doing. There's so much, it's kind of evolutionary, kind of have to take what works and throw away what doesn't.

And you just can't get stuck in a rut. Like you just have to be self-aware enough to see what needs to change year over year. So let me give just a little bit more context to my current job situation. And it's been this way for, I don't know, three ish years where I was put in a role or I took a role where I wasn't doing development full time.

where I was doing project work 50% of the time. And then other business related goals 50% of the time, which meant that I was now task switching throughout the day and not just like, Oh, I have to switch from doing writing code to doing a code review. Like, no, like big picture task switches.

And it was around that time that I [00:02:00] read a book called The Pomodoro Technique, which is, I mean, it's a fairly well known technique. And the high level idea, the part that that everyone remembers is that you divide your work up into 25 minute blocks. What people for tend to forget is that the idea is you actually plan out your day in 25 minute blocks. Right? So you, you sit down at the beginning of the day and like, Okay, what are the things I need to do? And start blanking it out. And if you can estimate what your work is gonna be in 25 minute blocks, then, you can say, Okay, well I think this is what I can get done by the end of my workday today.

The piece that people remember, like it is oddly emphasized is the five minute break, right? So the idea is you're 25 on five off, right? You're supposed to do that all day. I think that the five minute break is way overemphasized and people think [00:03:00] it's this thing where like, Oh, I can go, I don't know, watch TikTok or whatever,

And if you do that, the Pomodoro technique's not gonna work for you. But if you plan out what you're gonna do and you say, Okay, I'm gonna work, I'm gonna focus for 25 minutes. At the end of 25 minutes, that's when I'm gonna go get coffee, or that's when I'm gonna go get water. That's when I'm gonna go I don't know. Whatever that thing is you have to do. But it's like anyone can hit it and just be focused for 25 minutes. And then yeah, the other parts of the Pomodoro technique, that part at the beginning of the day where you plan out the rest and then throughout the day you're supposed to be tracking interruptions and so then there's like almost a mini retrospective at the end of the day. So you can say, Okay, well here, this was my plan, which is all written out, or mine's in a text file. So here's my plan, but what actually happened? And then how do I adjust? So maybe if there was a task that came [00:04:00] up that I didn't anticipate that threw off my plan, well, maybe I should have anticipated that better or maybe I should have blocked out time to deal with that up front. 

So that was, that was kind of the, the initial structure. And then at some point after I started doing that, my manager challenged the whole team to have three goals every day. And so then I kind of married these two ideas. So now what I do is every morning I sit down, Okay, what are the three things that I wanna accomplish today?

And so then once I know what my three things I wanna accomplish are for the day, then I start saying, Okay, well I'm going to allocate six Pomodoros to finishing this first goal and four Pomodoros to the next goal and whatever. And then there's always some, So my work is broken out into my top three goals. And then miscellaneous cuz there's, there's always that thing like, oh, we had to do health insurance enrollment recently.

And so like, okay, well I just gotta have some time during the day to [00:05:00] go talk to HR about that. But then that also gives me a chance at the end of the day to not only say, what was my plan? Did I work it? But like, okay, I had three goals, did I get 'em done? You know, if not, why. And then and then a lot of that rolls over to the next day.

It's like, Okay, well this didn't go the way I thought, and you take a new approach, but I definitely need to finish it. So this is now the big thing for the next day. 

The other thing I've really learned to like about this system is balancing the urgent and the important. Like there are some things on my calendar that are just always going to demand my time.

Like one of the things I'm doing a lot of right now is interviewing potential teammates. And well I've got a meeting on my calendar, which that meeting is on my calendar, is actually put there by our talent acquisition. And so that's gonna demand my attention. But if I'm gonna do a good job interviewing that person, I need to prepare for that interview.

And a lot of times, if I've got back to back meetings, that means I need to plan a, a Pomodoro earlier in the day to say, Okay, this is, this is what I need to do. I need to go to the resume and look at their [00:06:00] portfolio. And so having this plan, the Pomodoro plan, gives me a chance to say, Okay, I'm probably gonna need two Pomodoros for the interview and one for prep and that. So I make sure I get that prep done beforehand. I go in, I'm ready and can evaluate the candidate as fairly as possible.

**Steven Hicks:** Do you ever take time in the middle of the day to kind of shift the plan or do you do most of your planning at the beginning of the day, if not all of your planning at the beginning of the day? 

**Eric Potter:** I don't know that I ever like sit down and, and like say, Okay, I'm gonna replan. What definitely happens is you get part way through the day and like, well, this plan is over. Something came up there, there's a production bug or there, who knows what happened, who knows what fire needs to be put out and like, well guess I'm done with this plan for the day.

And so sometimes you have to say, Yeah, [00:07:00] set that piece of paper aside and, and do what you have to do. And you know, at first that's kind of frustrating. But I think that you just learn to live with a little bit of the messiness of work life and be like, Oh, okay, well today went in the wrong direction. Well, Wake up tomorrow. Clear eyes, big cup of coffee and get after it again. 

**Steven Hicks:** Yeah. Adapt to the uncertainty. Cool. It sounds like there's a lot of like self-reflection in here. Like that's a big part of it, both in terms of planning to know what you think you're gonna have time for, what you're gonna be interested in et cetera.

And then also like the end of the day, taking a look and seeing what your day actually looked like compared to what you thought it was going to look like or what you planned for. Is there any more thoughts that you have on that self-reflection side of it? 

**Eric Potter:** Yeah, a couple things.

I mean, one other side benefit, and again, this is more specific to my context and the context for a lot of people. I work in an environment where I have to build my hours, like I have to track my hours. And so that's kind of a [00:08:00] headache for some people. For me, it's like, oh, I get to the end of the day and like I can look, I can literally have a record of what I did half hour by half hour throughout the day.

And so that makes it really easy. 

Another thing, this is like another thing I started tracking. in conjunction with this is just having like some longer running notes. So a lot of times what I see in team retrospectives is that there's a lot of recency bias. Like, how well was the sprint, right?

Oh, look at the last three days. You know what didn't go well? You know that first week, that sprint, no one remembers. And so I've actually added, again, I really dork out on this. I have a text file format and it's, it's got, it's not quite marked down, but it's kind of obnoxiously structured, right?

And so then I'll make a note like, okay, well what, what did the team do well today? What did the team not do well today? And sometimes it's what I didn't do well today. And so I can see my plan, I can see what didn't happen or did [00:09:00] happen. And make notes about that. So then when I get to the end of a retro, or when we get to a end of a sprint, go into a retro I should have 10 of these text documents and I can at least skim through 'em real quick and see, okay, well what's worth bringing up with the whole team?

The other thing I will sometimes do, you see that recency bias in performance about your self evaluations for performance reviews. And so if something's really big, I'll make a note of it. Like, Hey, we, we shipped this feature and, I might not have a performance review for, I don't know, another six months, but I wanna have a record of this somewhere.

And so going into, my performance review, I will often skim through those and be like, Oh yeah, what were the week, the hits of the week? Cause a lot of times it's those like daily wins that then become, The things at the end of the year, it's like, Oh yeah, I forgot that we were in danger of slipping schedule and then we, we were able to come up with something. You know, that was a much bigger deal than we thought it was gonna be. And so [00:10:00] kind of having that look back at the year and I try to do those periodically. I'm just a big believer in looking back at what's gone well and what's not worked. 

One of the things that I endeavor to do, that never seems to work out as well as I think it will do, or I think it will, but like dedicating time to pain reduction. So what are the things that took me too much time, but should be automated as software developers. We all have that one thing that we have to do. Every time we do it. Like, Oh, I should just write a script to do this. But then you don't, and you go on. When you start looking back, you're like, Oh man, I did that thing five times this month. It's like, Oh, this definitely is worth some of my time to write a script to do this. Okay, well now this is, I have no problems blocking out two Pomodoros the next day to write a script to do this. Cause I, I'm starting to get this trend of like, Oh man, this takes like almost a Pomodoro [00:11:00] every week. You know, my ROI on this is, pays pay for itself by the end of the month. Or you know, sometimes you're like, you realize that like, Oh, I spend a little too much time on this. I should automate it. And I dunno. Then you don't, for whatever reason, you're just mad at yourself.

**Steven Hicks:** You just keep cutting yourself with the paper. Little tiny paper cuts over and over. 

**Eric Potter:** Is it Socrates that said the unexamined life's not worth living? So I try to live with the, the thought that the un unexamined work life is not efficient. I'm not gonna say it's not worth doing cuz you get paid, but... 

**Steven Hicks:** Yeah. You can definitely feel like you're stuck in a rut or like you can't escape some of those. Those feelings of just repetitive droning through something because you keep doing those, like you said, those same five things over and over and over. I'm really excited for you. I hope that at some point you get to meet my friend John, who is also my coworker, who is also gonna be a guest on this podcast cuz he also talks a [00:12:00] lot about what you just were just describing in regards to setting the time aside for improving like your developer, your own personal developer experience. He calls it his sharpening time. And he tried to get me on board with it too when I first started and I put it on my calendar.

That's the other thing I wanted to ask you about it is if you have a recurring time for that, that. Do you put in a reminder for yourself to do it every so often or does it just kind of come up when it comes up? 

**Eric Potter:** So I have a meeting with myself every single day at five. To do kind of my daily retro, and it kind of works. Like I said, I'm required to enter my time. So it's a nice reminder to be like, Okay, this is the end of the day where I do this at the end of the day, right? I will say that I blow that meeting off a lot, right? It's with me, right? So it doesn't really matter.

But it's definitely the first thing that slips out of my schedule. I would like to tell you that I'm much better at like actually getting some good reflection time in every day. But if I get it, three days out of five in a week , that's [00:13:00] probably enough. , and then yeah, then the yearly stuff that just comes up when my performance review is coming up and I just know, it's like, okay, well I've, I've got a year's worth of these notes that I can go back through.

And that's kind of a good time for me to block out a larger chunk of time to say, Okay, what did I accomplish in the last year? What, how did I grow? It's also a good time to start thinking about goals for the next year. And you were talking about the important but not urgent things -- a lot of times, Okay, well I have this growth goal for the next year and, I need to learn more about You know, Scrum or, some other like larger picture, leadership role type of thing, well, I gotta, I gotta start channeling out, carving out some Pomodoros in my work life. Maybe not every day but to accomplish these bigger goals.

So yeah, there's definitely some of this rolls into what I'm doing annually on, around my per vow. 

**Steven Hicks:** The recency bias stuff is interesting to me also. It's something that actually came up [00:14:00] yesterday in one of our sprint retros. The idea that it's really helpful to keep track of things that you wanna talk about in the retro throughout the sprint instead of just trying to remember it all at the end.

And so we've started doing things like actually creating the retro board at the beginning of the sprint so people can just go drop things in there so they don't have to remember 'em. But also I think for me there's a very positive psychological effect too. Being able to look back on the things that I've done and the things that I've accomplished, and it keeps me having... prevents me from getting into a dark place where like I've had a rough couple weeks or a rough month and all I can think about are the rough times that I've had for the last month because I can look back and see that there were other times and like, Oh yeah, I did do this amazing project two months ago, and that was great. Is there, do you have any thoughts about that? Like that psychological effect of keeping track of things? 

**Eric Potter:** Yeah, so I think there are two, and the first one is that throughout the day, every time I finish a Pomodoro I'm putting a check mark in there, right? Marking that off. [00:15:00] And so it's kind of good to be like, well, you know I don't know, maybe there was some... you know, they just had some npm packages that needed to be upgraded and I wasn't really excited about it. Like, Okay, yeah, I need to do that. And so now it's like, Okay, well here's a Pomodoro, check all these things out.

Boom. Got it done. All right, check. Got it. I won that one.

**Steven Hicks:** Yeah. You get that little rush from checking the box.

**Eric Potter:** Yeah. And I don't know, you would think that I would be, At a place in life where that wouldn't make me happy, but it does. And I actually have kind of embraced that, like, No, it's good. There are enough things in my work life that's kind of a slog. And it's like, no, I'll take the cheap wins. 

I think one of the things that's interesting about software development, maybe it's like there's in other professions too, is that when things go well, they generally go fast. And so there's some feature that a user requests. You know, the software is already well factored. The code's well-documented. The CI/CD pipeline is working flawlessly, and so it's like, [00:16:00] Oh man, we cranked this out. We got it done. Just a couple days. And then the next thing for whatever reason, like the code's not factored the right way and it's, and you know, it takes much longer.

Well then you look back like, well, what's the thing? What do you remember? Like, well, I remember where all I spent all my time and that was hard. And so like this thing that actually went the way that we wanted it to go, it's like, oh, forgot that. So like having that moment to say, Yeah, we, there was this feature and we got it done, ahead of schedule.

Man, you gotta take some time to appreciate that, cuz those are the things that kind of motivate you to do things the right way the next time. Cause like, okay, I remember that time that we got into this part of the code that is well maintained and, we had some wins there. Let's make sure the rest of our code looks that way too. 

**Steven Hicks:** Totally. Do you think you could take a step back a little bit and you talked about how you have a really specific, and I think you might have used the word annoying or something, maybe nerdy. I don't remember. I'm [00:17:00] not saying those things about you if you didn't use those words.

But you talked about how you have like this text file format to keep track of things. Do you think you could talk about that a little bit more? 

**Eric Potter:** Yeah. And I don't know, you will think, ...

**Steven Hicks:** if that's too deep of a question and you don't wanna share it, like we get too deep inside your brain, that's then let's just skip it. 

**Eric Potter:** But no, and just keep in mind, this is the thing that, like I, when I started doing Pomodoro technique I was doing kind of by the book, which is literally blank text file with 16 spaces, and then some spaces to track interruptions. And then it evolved from there to like, okay, well I'm gonna break this up and now, so I've got goal number one.

I'm gonna fill in goal number one. I gotta put Pomodoros under that goal number two. And then you, at some point you realize like, Oh, well, I need something, I need this thing for replacing our goals. So now I've got a fourth heading for miscellaneous . And I don't know, Then I came up with this weird system where you know, instead of having one line per Pomo, I was like, Well, this is the task and it's gonna take two Pomodoros, so I'm actually just gonna have two O'S [00:18:00] in front of it, and then I'll go to X them out as I get done throughout the day.

And then at some point, I was in some retrospective and realized I was, I was annoyed by the recency bias. I'm like, I should just every day start tracking this. So I took our retrospective questions and just paste them into the bottom of that text file. And so now, not only do I have, here's my plan for the day, and at the bottom I track what went well, what went poorly.

And so there's all these headings, and the headings are denoted with double equal signs. And I now have a script. So it's like this template and I have a script that makes a copy of that every morning with that day's date. 

**Steven Hicks:** I love it. 

**Eric Potter:** And then there's some things you just have to do every day. So I block out a Pomodoro every day for code reviews. And so my template literally has you know, something already in there like, Okay, I'm gonna do code reviews today. I was trying to think that there's... I guess the other thing I have in there I, I have one Pomodoro in my template for learning [00:19:00] initiatives. Where it's like, I can spend a little bit of time every day learning. Now that one, admittedly, depending on the day, sometimes I just delete that one. But at least it's a conscious thought to say, Okay, today is not the day for me to go do some more sharpening of the ax. I'm gonna take it out.

But my default position is to have a little bit of learning time in there somewhere. 

**Steven Hicks:** In regards to the code review it sounds like you kind of batch those activities into one Pomodoro. Is there a concept of batching, is that something that you find elsewhere in planning your Pomodoros or is that maybe just a little bit of a stretch?

**Eric Potter:** So one of the things that I'll often do with the Pomodoro technique is try to not respond to email or instant messages throughout the Pomodoro, like just stay focused. But a lot of times, depending on what's going on, I will get behind. Like, I'm not gonna ever catch up [00:20:00] on my email five minutes at a time.

And so then it's gonna say, Okay, well at some point in the day, I'm just gonna take a whole pomodoro and try and get to inbox zero. And so, yeah, I think it's really healthy to kind of batch those things up and say, Okay, this is my 25 minute window to try and get caught up. You know?

Cause again, some emails are from clients and they're urgent. Some are like, well, this needs to be responded to today. You get to the end of the day like, Oh man, I got a whole pile. See, I like batching those things together. You know, there's some other administrative things that I have to do with regard to like providing performance feedback for my teammates.

So a lot of times like, okay, well it takes 25 minutes and get those knocked out. And so trying to like squeeze those into one 25 minute window and then get back to my development work, I think is helpful. Also, I think especially with email, Not only is it batched, it's almost like a race against the clock.

It's like, okay, I've just gotta get these knocked out. 25 minutes. [00:21:00] And so it kind of gives some artificial urgency that maybe helps me get through it faster.

Cuz you're not gonna give yourself more than that one pomodoro. Once that time is done, it's gone. 

**Steven Hicks:** Right. That's fun. One of the things you said pretty early on was that you think that people are overly focused on the breaks, the five minute breaks. I'm curious. How do you handle your breaks and like, I have to imagine there is value there for you for sure. And whether it's giving yourself the actual break from the work to let stuff process or walk away or get water or whatever. But I was thinking maybe you could talk a little bit more about what you do there and what the value is that you get out of the breaks.

**Eric Potter:** Yeah. One of the mistakes I made early on, Was that I would work for 25 minutes and then the timer would go off and like, Okay, well now I can go look at my fantasy football results. Or I could, insert hobby here, right? Oh, you can go watch a YouTube video. Well, [00:22:00] inevitably if you do that, now your focus is somewhere else, and that bleeds back into the next Pomodoro. Cuz now it's like, okay, well what was I working on? But if you just take some time, stand up, stretch, Like I said, that's usually when I go get coffee or water. The building I work in is downtown and so it's, I can't quite make it around the block in five minutes, but if I cut through the back alley, I can get out and get some steps.

And one of the things that can be healthy about that is an idea that I learned in the book, Pragmatic Thinking and Learning is that a lot of times if you're kind of stuck on a problem, as long as you're staring at the code, you're not going to come up with the out of the box solution. And so for me five minutes, a lot of times like, just get up, get the blood flowing a little bit.

But not trying to think about, it's not like I'm necessarily trying to clear my mind, but a lot of times, like [00:23:00] not trying to shift my focus other than getting up and walking around a lot of times like, Oh, why didn't I, I wonder if I checked, that stored procedure. Maybe I didn't look at that.

And so you get back to your desk and it's like, oh, okay, now I've got some new things to try. I also work in a three story building, with two stairwells. And so a lot of times what I'll do is literally like walk to the top floor on one stairwell, walk over and like do a little lap.

If it's not nice outside or, I mean, the other thing that I definitely do actually, like I will literally like grab a notebook. I keep a notebook with me, basically all day, and a pen. I'll literally go for a walk and just like start jotting things down as I think about 'em.

And I don't know, I find that to be really helpful.

**Steven Hicks:** Yeah. Getting away from the problem is definitely, weirdly, sometimes the best way to solve the problem. To just completely walk away. 

**Eric Potter:** Yeah. And have you read either [00:24:00] pragmatic thinking and learning or thinking fast and slow?

**Steven Hicks:** I've read Thinking Fast and slow. I haven't read Pragmatic Thinking and Learning. I did write it down as something that I definitely wanna look into. 

**Eric Potter:** Yeah. But it's interesting to me cause I, most people I talk to have had this experience, right? Where you're just banging your head on a problem, you can't figure it out, and then you're mowing the lawn, you're walking the dog driving, taking a shower, whatever.

And you have that realization. And you have this other idea. And the idea, I think it's originally from thinking fast and slow and referenced in the other book, is that the way your brain kind of processes information is that when it's no longer concerned with adding things to your short term memory, it kind of like churns through 'em.

And so when you're doing these more repetitive tasks, like if you're mowing the lawn, you probably mow the lawn the same way. And so your brain almost has like a chance to not check out, but it switches into a different mode. And so like [00:25:00] try, I mean, there's a reason I like walking around the block cause it's the same block every time.

And it just kind of gives me a chance to be like, Okay, what's, what's going on? So it's kind of weird to like try and trick your brain into being in a different head space, but Yep, that's what I'm trying to do. 

**Steven Hicks:** Yeah, for sure. Let it process things asynchronously instead of synchronously.

Maybe you could talk a little bit about are there any, any things that you struggle with that like you haven't figured out yet that you've been working towards? And you think that there's probably a way that things can get better for you, but you're not sure how? 

**Eric Potter:** You know, I think that the biggest negative is that, I mean, it's good to have a plan, but you just have to be willing to get rid of the plan. Like there are just some days where it's laughable. I get to the end of the day and like, man, I had three goals and I didn't accomplish any, and so you just kinda have to be okay with that.

I think that, I mean, one of the challenges with Pomodoro technique is that it's not super great at handling like the really [00:26:00] small things, like what are you supposed to do if something is too big for five minutes and not big enough for its own pomodoro. And maybe I'm just overthinking it. It always irritates me, that I can't make this thing fit into my plan.

I know I've had a lot of debates. I know there are some people that really dislike disengaging after 25 minutes. You know, I had teammate and he is the kinda guy that could focus in. It was infuriating to him to like, Man, I was just getting in the zone at 25 minutes. Why am I stopping?

And I've read some people do like a a 50 and 10 instead of 25 and five. So I think there are probably some things I could do better there. I've not done enough experiments with a 50 and 10. I probably should, and I just haven't.

**Steven Hicks:** Do you, along those lines, do you ever have those kinds of moments where you've assigned yourself a pomodoro or a certain task for a Pomodoro and you start it up and you try to start it and you just like can't get into it and there's something about it that you know, it's [00:27:00] wrong time of the day, or it's you're hungry or whatever.

For some reason you're just, This isn't working, and it takes you 15 minutes to get started before you actually feel comfortable and then along the lines of what that person was saying to you, you're like, Oh, I just started, but I'm done. It's time for me to move on. 

**Eric Potter:** That's an interesting question and one of the things I like about the Pomodoro technique is kind of thinking about something in those 25 minute chunks.

So a lot of times, You can give yourself one... like if I'm like a working in section of the code that I've never worked in before, or, maybe it's a repo, I don't even have cloned down. It's like, okay, well I can have a whole Pomodoro just for like that getting started.

Like, I've gotta find the repo and clone it and I don't, maybe there's some build tools I need to install. Let's get all that stuff outta the way. And so you sometimes you almost need like a startup Pomodoro to get that going. 

One of the things that's interesting about that you reflect on it, like, Man, that that took me a whole hour to get this thing up and running.

Well, maybe [00:28:00] that changes how, if I wanna bring someone else on to look at it like, well, I gotta remember to probably take them an hour to get started too. 

I definitely have , there are times, where like you sit down, you start a Pomodoro, and for whatever reason, it's just not there.

And one of the things in the official Pomodoro technique is like, yeah, sometimes you just have to cancel it, whether it's an interruption or something and you track it and you say like, what happened? And this gets back to knowing yourself. I do think it's really valuable for people to know what time of day certain tasks fit in.

You know, for me personally, I feel like I do my best work between 10 and noon. And I don't know why that is. I find my first pomodoro of the day is not my best. Like, I intentionally try to not write code when I first get to my desk. Now I'm cheating a little bit because like I just told you, I spend the first chunk of my day planning out the rest of the day, but a lot of times it's like, okay, well the first thing I need, there's this [00:29:00] other little chore I need to go do and try and get some of these things cleaned out. So that the hardest thing I need to do every day, I want to try and do between 10 and 12.

And then, I've got another solid window from I dunno, from like two to four. But I also know, my attention span starts to dwindle near the end of the day. And so it's like, okay, well let me ..., what are the things I can put off towards the end of the day? Cuz they're smaller or like they're, maybe it's more busy work. 

**Steven Hicks:** You have to think about it less, like, it doesn't require you to get into that deep flow or to build up some big model in your head to do it. 

**Eric Potter:** Right. And I'm, I'm not saying that like every day at 4, like, Oh, I'm done. Like I definitely can push through, when it's important, I can push through. But I also try and be aware enough to kind of plan my day and say , Okay, when have I, when have I got it? When have I not and what are the things that I do that kind of amp me up to get me going throughout the rest of the day.

**Steven Hicks:** Are there any [00:30:00] conditions under which you find yourself not using the Pomodoro or the systems that work for you? 

**Eric Potter:** Yeah. And they're not my favorite days, but there are definitely days when I have so many meetings. I get into the office and I look at my calendar, I'm like, What's the point of planning my day?

Like my day has been planned for me already, and it's, I've got six meetings and when I'm not in meetings, I need to be preparing for meetings. It's like, oh, there's just no point. And so I don't, I mean, there are definitely other days when I have something urgent at the beginning of the day and I miss that planning phase.

And it seems like if I miss my block of time at the beginning of the day to plan out my day, then I, I never get back to it. 

**Steven Hicks:** Yeah. You just get sucked in right from the start. 

**Eric Potter:** Yeah. Like you get to work, or like heading into work and you get an email and... So at least for me, there's a few minute walk between the building and the parking lot.

[00:31:00] Like I already know from my email before I get to my desk, something ons the fire and I have to hit the ground running. So there are definitely days when I don't... I've never, it'd be interesting to look back at the last year and see how many of these Pomodoro time sheets I have for myself.

But it's definitely, yeah, there are definitely days when I don't. 

**Steven Hicks:** Do you have any stories of Times that your systems have either completely saved you or completely failed you? 

**Eric Potter:** I think the times that it has bailed me out would be the times when there was like some kind of prep task where it's like, I'm not gonna be ready to go into that meeting if I don't have a solid half hour to have lot of materials.

**Steven Hicks:** Or like the interview kind of situation that you were talking about. 

**Eric Potter:** Yeah. And so sometimes you just realize like, Oh, you've got this thing just has to happen. And again, it probably is more beneficial in days when I have back to back [00:32:00] meetings where it's like, Okay, well I've got two meetings in a row.

First one, I'm ready for whatever. But that second one, I need to have done some prep work. And so you start realizing like, Oh man, if I don't do this prep work in this Pomodoro, I'm not gonna get it done

In terms of when it hurts me... there's probably a little too much emphasis that gets given to things once it's written down, right? Like, All of a sudden I've wrote it down and it has to happen. And there are probably times when I should be a little more flexible and realize that, something else came up important.

I suppose one of the things that I sometimes fight against is the maxim that work expands to fill the time allotted. And so there's definitely a little bit of a negative pressure where it's like, okay. I had planned an hour for this and I got it done with 45 minutes and there's probably a little bit of, I don't know, negative pressure to maybe just throw it into [00:33:00] neutral and coast. I got this done and you know, I have, I've suddenly got an extra 10 minutes. Maybe let's not do something. But I think if that happened a lot, I would come up with a better system. And so it must not, I don't think it happens too much. 

**Steven Hicks:** Yeah. I think it'd be an indication that like your planning was a little bit off in terms of what you expected to be one full Pomodoro versus not.

**Eric Potter:** Yeah. 

**Steven Hicks:** Cool. Is there anything that I missed in this conversation that you think is interesting or fun to share about about all of this? 

**Eric Potter:** I think one of the things that I've been kind of obsessed with, and I dunno if this is interesting, let's see if I can even show it to you... so I have a variety of timers. And I know this won't make for good fodder on the podcast. But you're now looking straight down at this timer that I made. It's just got two buttons. 

Oh, that's cool. 

And then let's see if I start the next one. So I dunno how well it's coming through on the webcam, but right now... So it's actually starting a break. So it's [00:34:00] yellow and over the next five minutes it will fade to red. And then five minutes is up, it'll blink red. And then for the Pomodoro, it starts green and fades to blue and then fades to red. 

**Steven Hicks:** Wow. 

**Eric Potter:** So I dunno. It was a fun little Arduino project I built.

I also have, there's some good Pomodoro timers online. At one point, So I'm a Windows user, not a Mac user, sorry. But windows has that feature where the icons on your task bar can have a progress bar on 'em. And I decided I want a Pomodoro timer that took advantage of that task bar feature.

So I actually have, it's up on GitHub, where my timer's right in my task bar. I've used other ones. I don't know, like why that is such a weird obsession for me that I've built two hardware and one software Pomodoro timer when there are plenty of good apps out there for it. 

**Steven Hicks:** But, I mean, it feels nice cuz it's not like you're building an entire clone of Twitter or something, you know? It's like a, it's a smaller bite size project, so if you wanna scratch an itch, a particular itch, whether it's a hardware thing or it's a, Oh, I've never done something in [00:35:00] Windows development or with a task bar, it's a complete problem that you have to solve, but it's a small-ish problem, which is nice.

**Eric Potter:** Yeah. And then the other thing I would say I end up using quite a bit: there's a music collection you can buy. The whole set is a zip called music to code by, by a guy named Carl Franklin. And there are these instrumental pieces, It's kinda like a bluesy, jazzy thing that he wrote for the Pomodoro technique.

So they're 25 minutes long, so when the song ends, you're like, Oh, that's the end of the pomodoro. He wrote them to not be distracting, but also to not be boring. And then, I dunno if this is true of all of them. A lot of 'em, there's like some subtle change in the last five minutes, so you kind of know that like, okay, this is coming, but the change is so subtle. I would've not known that if I hadn't heard him say that in an inter interview. 

**Steven Hicks:** That's cool. I'll check that out too. I appreciate you taking the time and hanging out with me.

**Eric Potter:** Like I love talking about this stuff. I love learning what other people do [00:36:00] and you know, like I said, I forget who first told me about the Pomodoro technique. Like there's so many things I heard other people do and I kind of incorporated into what I do and yeah, I doubt anyone in the world will copy what I do, lock, stock and barrel.

I hope that there is like something that I do, that they like, oh, they find helpful. 

**Steven Hicks:** Yeah, it's maybe a little bit of a reflection of the kind of people I surround myself with, I think. But I think that there's a little bit of overlap in terms of like, the things that you've talked about and things that I know some of the other people I'm gonna be talking to are gonna be talking about, Which I think that for me, that builds the case that these are good solutions for people to think about.

**Eric Potter:** Oh, I know one other thing that's worth mentioning And I, this is one of those things that's kind of been on my to-do list. I never got into it. But I know some people that use their Pomodoro timer and kind of like leave it somewhere where people can see it. This is more like if you're in the office, right? So to try like, they're trying to maintain focus. So there's a guy named David, Shepherd, that had done some [00:37:00] experiments with this where he is like, my whole team knows that this timer is on my desk and you walk in and see it and gauge your interruption of me based on , where I am in this timer and like the importance.

So obviously like if there's something important then you have to tap me on my shoulders. But if you can see that I've just got a few minutes left and it's not really that important. How about Let me focus? Come back. You can come back. And so that's one of those things at some point, I would like to try a little more and just explore.

As a team, can we all adopt this technique in a way where we interact with each other better? The other thing that, that we've done some experiments with, with mixed results is using a pomodoro while mobbing. Because one of the things that I think you can kind of run into collectively in a mob session is that everyone kind of [00:38:00] gets a little bit of malaise and then all of a sudden, instead of one person kind of bogging down, it's like, Man, I've got three or four people here that just kind of stuck on this problem.

And so some of our mobbing sessions, we'll actually use a Pomodoro timer. It's like, Okay, this, this is the case for the whole mob to take a break. The other good thing about that is, trying to line up bathroom breaks when you're mobbing. Be like, okay, well we've got five minutes here and instead of staggering out one bathroom break, per person over the next hour, let's let everyone go and come back and we'll be here.

I think those are two areas, like the focus light and then Pomodoros as a team that I think I could get better at. 

**Steven Hicks:** The Pomodoros as a team. There definitely is a thing where it can be really easy to not notice how people are feeling in some, in a session like that until it's kind of too late [00:39:00] where you're just like, nobody wants to be here right now. So I like the idea of structuring the breaks and making sure, because I usually forget, it's usually we're 45 minutes an hour in and I'm like we need to take a break. But we should have done it sooner. 

Awesome Eric. This was really fun.
