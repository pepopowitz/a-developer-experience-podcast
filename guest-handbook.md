# What to expect as a guest

Thank you for being a guest on How Devs Work! This is kind of an experiment for me, but I'm giving it a lot of thought. To make you comfortable with your experience, this is a guide on what to expect as a guest.

## Scheduling

- Please book an hour at https://calendly.com/steven-j-hicks/how-devs-work-recording. 
  - That hour includes a buffer for us to warm up & discuss details of the conversation before recording.
  - If you're unable to find a time in the slots available, let me know what times of day work best for you and I'll add some slots!

## Before recording

- Take a look at this [recording handbook](./recording-handbook.md) for tips on recording the best audio possible. Don't worry - you won't need to buy any equipment!
- Prior to our recording, I'll send you a link to a https://zencastr.com/ recording session. Zencastr is web-based and you won't need to install anything. It will want access to your microphone & camera.

## Recording

- We'll record audio only, but we'll also share video within zencastr so we can see each other. 
- We'll begin the recording with some small talk to get comfortable. How 'bout them Bucks?
- Then we'll discuss logistical details about the conversation we're going to have.
- Then we'll record a conversation!
- Don't worry about ums, ahs, tripping over your words, etc. I'll be slicing up and editing our conversation to fit into multiple episodes. I'm also pretty good about stopping us when we need a re-take.

## What will we talk about?

I'm really interested in hearing about the system(s) you use to get your work done on a daily basis! Productivity hacks, task management, strategies for deep focus, etc. Whether you feel like you've got your systems all figured out or not, I'm interested to hear about what systems work and don't work for you. 

I'll be using the following questions to guide our conversation. We might talk a lot about some of these questions; we might completely skip others. Don't sweat it if it seems like you don't have big answers to all of these questions! I'm not going to release the conversations start-to-finish (see [Editing](#editing) below). 

- Tell me about yourself!
- Is there anything about you, your position, or your history that makes your systems of working notable?
- What works for you?
  - What system(s) are critical for you getting things done?
  - What tool(s) are critical for your systems?
- What doesn't work for you?
  - What have you tried that doesn't work?
  - What doesn't even appeal to you to try?
- What haven't you figured out yet? 
  - Are there things about your systems that you wish you could improve?
- How do you avoid distractions? How do you gain/retain focus?
- Under what conditions do you stop using your systems?
  - When things are going well? When things are not going well?
- How has your system evolved over time?
  - Are there any events that led to your current system?
  - What are you "running from"? There's something that prompted you to develop these systems. What is it?
- Do you have any stories of when your system(s) have failed you?
  - Or stories of what it looks like when your systems aren't working well?
- Do you have any stories of when your system(s) have saved you?
  - Or stories of what it looks like when your systems are working well?
- How does your system affect you psychologically/emotionally?
  - How do you feel when you're following the system?
  - How do you feel when you aren't?
- What have I missed? Is there something interesting about your systems that my questions haven't covered?

## Editing

After I finish recording conversations with guests, I'll edit them for sound quality & content. 

Then I'll cut the conversations up a fair amount. My intentions are for each episode to include bits of audio from multiple guests, to tell cohesive stories from multiple perspectives.

## Release dates

- I'll be releasing episodes starting early in 2022.
- I'll reach out to you to let you preview each episode before I ship it.
