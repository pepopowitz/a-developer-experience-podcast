# What to expect as a guest

Thank you for being a guest on How Devs Work! This is kind of an experiment for me, but I'm giving it a lot of thought. To make you comfortable with your experience, this is a guide on what to expect as a guest.

## Scheduling

- I'll reach out with a calend.ly to schedule an hour for us to talk
  - That hour includes a buffer for us to warm up & discuss details of the conversation before recording.
- As a rough estimate, I'm planning to record conversations in November/December 2021.

## Recording

- Before we record, I'll share with you: 
  - a guide that will help you prepare for recording the best audio possible, in case you haven't recorded a podcast before. Don't worry - you won't need to buy any equipment!
  - a link to a https://zencastr.com/ recording session. Zencastr is web-based and you won't need to install anything.
- We'll begin the recording with some small talk to get comfortable.
- Then we'll discuss logistical details about the conversation we're going to have.
- Then we'll record a conversation!
- Don't worry about ums, ahs, tripping over your words, etc. I'll be slicing up and editing our conversation to fit into multiple episodes. I'm also pretty good about stopping us when we need a re-take.

## What will we talk about?

I'm really interested in hearing about the system(s) you use to get your work done on a daily basis! Productivity hacks, task management, strategies for deep focus, ....

I'll be using these questions to guide our conversation: 

- Tell me about yourself!
- Is there anything about you, your position, or your history that makes your systems of working notable?
- What works for you?
  - What system(s) are critical for you getting things done?
  - What tool(s) are critical for your systems?
- What doesn't work for you?
  - What have you tried that doesn't work?
  - What doesn't even appeal to you to try?
- What haven't you figured out yet? 
  - Are there things about your systems that you wish you could improve?
- How do you avoid distractions? How do you gain/retain focus?
- Under what conditions do you stop using your systems?
  - When things are going well? When things are not going well?
- How has your system evolved over time?
  - Are there any events that led to your current system?
  - What are you "running from"? There's something that prompted you to develop these systems. What is it?
- Do you have any stories of when your system(s) have failed you?
  - Or stories of what it looks like when your systems aren't working wel
- Do you have any stories of when your system(s) have saved you?
  - Or stories of what it looks like when your systems are working well?
- How does your system affect you psychologically/emotionally?
  - How do you feel when you're following the system?
  - How do you feel when you aren't?
- What have I missed? Is there something interesting about your systems that my questions haven't covered?

We might talk a lot about one of these questions; we might completely skip another. We'll roll with the punches.

## Editing

After I finish recording conversations with guests, I'll edit them for sound quality & content. I'll also be cutting the conversations up a fair amount -- portions of your interview will appear in multiple episodes, depending on how the stories fit together.

## Release dates

- I'll be releasing episodes starting early in 2022.
- I'll reach out to you to let you preview each episode before I ship it.
